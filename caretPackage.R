#q1
#In the exercise in Q6 from Comprehension Check: Trees and Random Forests,
#we saw that changing nodesize to 50 and setting maxnodes to 25 yielded smoother results.
#Let's use the train function to help us pick what the values of nodesize and maxnodes should be.
#From the caret description of methods, we see that we can't tune the maxnodes parameter or the nodesize
#argument with randomForests. So we will use the __Rborist__ package and tune the minNode argument.
#Use the train function to try values minNode <- seq(25, 100, 25). Set the seed to 1.

#Which value minimizes the estimated RMSE?

#Part of the code to make a scatterplot along with the prediction

#Q3

#Use the rpart function to fit a classification tree to the
#tissue_gene_expression dataset. Use the train function to estimate
#the accuracy. Try out cp values of seq(0, 0.1, 0.01).
#Plot the accuracies to report the results of the best model. Set the seed to 1991.

#Which value of cp gives the highest accuracy?

#q4
#Study the confusion matrix for the best fitting classification tree from the exercise in Q3.
#What do you observe happening for the placenta samples?
confusionMatrix(predict(train_rpart,x), y)
#risposta:
#Placenta samples are being classified somewhat evenly across tissues


#q5

#Note that there are only 6 placentas in the dataset. By default,
#rpart requires 20 observations before splitting a node.
#That means that it is difficult to have a node in which placentas are the majority. 
#Rerun the analysis you did in the exercise in Q3, but this time, 
#allow rpart to split any node by using the argument control = rpart.control(minsplit = 0). 
#Look at the confusion matrix again to determine whether the accuracy increases. 
#Again, set the seed to 1991.

#What is the accuracy now?
